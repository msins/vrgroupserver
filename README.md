## VR-group university project
- Webapp used for managing surveys for different games, scenarios and questions through web interface. Newest information or statistics about any game can be obtained through the Rest API.
- Made with Vaadin, Hibernate, Jersey. Running on Jetty. Some other libraries used are OpenCSV, Gson, Guava, Log4j 2.
- Didn't use MVP since ui is pretty simple, probably should have

## Testing
- Run `mvn jetty:run` within the vrgroupserver directory and open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
(make sure to change the port, from 80 to 8080 in pom.xml line 248, or run with sudo on [http://localhost](http://localhost))
## Installation (for Ubuntu)
```
git clone https://github.com/msins/vrgroupserver.git <dir>
bash <dir>/vrgroupserver/setup/setup.sh <dir>/vrgroupserver/
```

## Current rest API v1
- returns JSON-formatted data.
- base url `http://<ip>/api/`
#### Implementations
- `GET /v1/games/<game_name>` fetches all the relevant data for a game
```json
{
  "scenarios": [
    {
      "scenario": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Default"
      },
      "questions": [
        {
          "id": 3,
          "text": "Question text 1",
          "choices": [
            {
              "id": 7,
              "value": "Choice text 1"
            },
            {
              "id": 8,
              "value": "Choice text 2"
            }
          ],
          "type": "MULTIPLE_CHOICE"
        },
        {
          "id": 4,
          "text": "Question text 2",
          "choices": [
            {
              "id": 9,
              "value": "Choice text 1"
            },
            {
              "id": 10,
              "value": "Choice text 2"
            },
            {
              "id": 11,
              "value": "Choice text 3"
            }
          ],
          "type": "SCALING"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
- `POST /v1/games/<game_name>` saves answer for a given user (project required basic user information)
- this could(should) have been implemented to receive json containing only ids and not other redundant information but it was easier for other groups in project to use this format
```json
{
  "choice":{
    "id":7,
    "value":"Choice text 1"
  },
  "question":{
    "choices":[
      {
        "id":7,
        "value":"Choice text 1"
      },
      {
        "id":8,
        "value":"Choice text 2"
      }
    ],
    "id":3,
    "text":"Question text 1",
    "type":"MULTIPLE_CHOICE"
  },
  "scenario":{
    "id":2,
    "name":"Default"
  },
  "user":{
    "age":21,
    "email":"email@domain.com",
    "gender":"M",
    "name":"name"
  }
}
```
- Csv can be fetched with `GET /v1/csv/<game_name>`
